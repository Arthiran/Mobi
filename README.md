This project is a way to test AR features in Unreal Engine. The premise of this project is to create a pet dog which can respond to vocal commands.

For speech recognition, I used an outdated Sphinx plugin made for Unreal Engine (https://github.com/shanecolb/sphinx-ue4) and updated it to work with Unreal Engine 4.27.1.
